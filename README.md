# Useless Version Control

uvc is useless, dirty and totally unnecessary version control tool made for educational purpose. Please, don't use it. This tool will be abandoned before reaching any useful state. The purpose of this repository is to help me learn go and test its features.

Does it work?

Yes.

Is it clean?

No.

This program is based on Global Information Tracker, commited by Linus Torvalds in [Initial revision of "git", the information manager from hell](https://github.com/git/git/tree/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290) and use similar concepts for storing and managing code. 

uvc is using objects to store files with code and organize them in revision, a point in time snapshot of the repository. Revisions are organized in switchable branches.
